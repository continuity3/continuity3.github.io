Hi! I am **YuZhou Wu**, a Master’s student in **Robotics** at the **University of Sheffield** (expected Sept 2025).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Robotics**, **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** models, and **efficient spatiotemporal representation learning**, with a particular focus on **4D perception**, **multi-agent reasoning**, and **Transformer acceleration** for real-time embodied systems.

I am actively preparing for **PhD applications** and am interested in research-oriented positions related to **robot learning**, **embodied AI**, and **large-scale multimodal models**.

## 🔍 Research Interests

My current research focuses on:

- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models**
  - Policy learning for embodied agents (e.g., LIBERO, DROID-style datasets)
  - Action tokenization, latent action modeling, and policy generalization
  - Streaming inference and real-time deployment constraints

- **4D Point Cloud Perception & Transformers**
  - PointTransformer / SpUNet architectures for dynamic scenes
  - Cross-frame attention and **KV-Cache enhanced Transformers**
  - World-coordinate alignment and temporal token reuse

- **Efficient & Interpretable Deep Models**
  - Token pruning, attention sparsification, and quantization-aware training
  - KV cache reuse for streaming perception
  - Model compression for deployment on resource-constrained systems
